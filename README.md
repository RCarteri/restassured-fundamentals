# Fundamentals of Test Automation in Java
by Andrejs Doronins

Automated tests undeniably benefit software projects by protecting against bugs. However, a typical automated test suite becomes slower, more unstable, and more difficult to maintain as it grows, thus becoming a costly liability, and not an asset. In this course, Fundamentals of Test Automation in Java, you will learn the underlying principles that form the basis of long-term successful test automation endeavours. First, you will see how to apply the FIRST principles, which define essential test characteristics, such as speed and stability. Then, you will explore how to recognize the most important and valuable scenarios for your automated tests where bugs are likely to occur with BICEP and CORRECT principles. Finally, you will discover what not to do, meaning which anti-patterns exist in test automation and what you can do to avoid them. When you are finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge of foundational test automation principles to develop and maintain an efficient and value delivering suite of automated tests.
